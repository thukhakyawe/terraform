# Day 1: Introduction to Infrastructure as Code: Exploring Terraform

🧪 Hands-On Lab: Explore Terraform Basics
Prerequisites

An AWS account (free tier)

A computer with internet access

Lab Steps

### Step 1: Create Your AWS Account

Go to https://aws.amazon.com

Click “Create an AWS Account”

Follow the signup process (requires credit card but we’ll use free tier)

Verify your email

### Step 2: Understand the AWS Free Tier

AWS provides 750 hours/month of t2.micro instances (free for 12 months)

We’ll stay within free tier limits throughout this series

Always remember to destroy resources after practice!

### Step 3: Familiarize with AWS Console

Log into AWS Console: https://console.aws.amazon.com

Navigate to EC2 Dashboard

Browse around - notice how many clicks it takes to launch an instance

Don’t create anything yet - just explore

### Step 4: Understand the Manual Process Count the steps to manually create an EC2 instance:

Choose AMI (Amazon Machine Image)

Choose Instance Type

Configure Instance Details

Add Storage

Add Tags

Configure Security Group

Review and Launch

Create/Select Key Pair

That’s 8+ steps with dozens of options! Tomorrow, we’ll do this with just a few lines of code.

### Step 5: Reflection Questions Think about these (write down your answers):

How would you recreate this exact setup in another region?

How would you document all the settings you chose?

How would you track who made what changes?

How would you share this setup with your team?

These questions highlight why IaC is essential!
